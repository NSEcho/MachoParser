# MachoParser

MachoParser is a parser of MachO filetypes, used in iOS, Mac OS, youNameItAppleOS operating systems. I am writing it as simple as possible so other people can easily digest it and perhaps contribute to it, or fix bugs when you find some.

# Installation

You just need _cmake_ in order to build it.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/XdaemonX/MachoParser.git
$ cd MachoParser
$ cd build && cmake ..
$ ./MachoParser
```
